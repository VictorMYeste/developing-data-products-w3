## Area from major municipalities from Spain

At the next plot we can see the six only municipalities from Spain with more than 500.000 people and their area in km^2.

```{r cities}
library(plotly)
cities <- data.frame(name = c("Madrid", "Barcelona", "Valencia", "Sevilla", "Zaragoza", "MÃ¡laga"),
    pop = c(3334730, 1664182, 800215, 691395, 681877, 578460),
    area = c(604.45, 101.35, 134.65, 140.8, 973.78, 398.25),
    col = c("> 1 million pop", "> 1 million pop", "> 750 thousand pop", "> 500 thousand pop", "> 500 thousand pop", "> 500 thousand pop"))
plot_ly(cities, x = cities$pop, y = cities$area, mode = "markers", color = as.factor(cities$col))
